# CS452-Project-2
The second project for Computer Graphics

## Shapes
We had decided to draw 5 shapes including:
- The Maoi head from Lab 4.
- A sphere
- A cube
- An octahedron
- a tetrahedron

The tetrahedron and cube were textured, and the rest were applied colors through
the colorVector variable. The colors are randomly chosen, and described in the
interaction section.

## Animation
The shapes are moving along a rotation of the same amplitude in all three dimensions.
The amplitude is 3 variables named alph1, alph2, and alph3, which are all 0.005*c1,
where c1 is a number controlled by a slider that goes between -5 and 5.

## Interaction
There are two different different ways of interacting with the scene. The first is
randomizing colors
